                <p>Northern Innovation and Empowerment Hub (NIEHUB) is a social enterprise entity based and registered in Kenya
                    as a Company Limited by Guarantee. Headquartered in Garissa, Northern Kenya, NIEHUB supports and empowers
                    youth, girls and women in Garissa, Wajir and Mandera through ICT skills, social entrepreneurship, mentorship
                    as well as career and job training.</p>
                <p>NIEHUB was conceptualized in 2019 to help improve the lives of the marginalized youth, girls and women in
                    Northern Kenya. Through well thought programs, the innovation hub offers a unique platform that equips the
                    target group with essential life skills through professional, technological, entrepreneurial and technical
                    initiatives. The hub provides creative working space to empower the target groups with business and soft
                    skills so that they create economic opportunities for themselves.</p>
                <p>According to the 2018 Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the unemployment rate among the youth is 70
                    percent which translates to seven million. Counties in Northern Kenya that have been marginalized since
                    independence, rank top in the unemployment index survey. This has resulted in high poverty rates, substance
                    abuse, disillusionment that has caused increase in depression and mental diseases as well as recruitment
                    into extremist groups.</p>
                <p>Access to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure and services in Northern Kenya is
                    among the lowest in the country. NIEHUB seeks to bridge this gap by providing a convenient platform to
                    empower the community… The employment market for young people has changed significantly over the past two
                    decades under the combined impacts of globalization, market liberalization and the adoption of innovative
                    approaches.</p>
